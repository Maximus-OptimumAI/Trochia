# Phase 1 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | Vitest (unit/integration) + Playwright (e2e) + MSW (network mocking) |
| **Config file** | none — Wave 0 installs (`vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`) |
| **Quick run command** | `pnpm vitest run` |
| **Full suite command** | `pnpm vitest run && pnpm playwright test` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~TBD seconds (planner to estimate) |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `pnpm vitest run`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `pnpm vitest run && pnpm playwright test`
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** TBD seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| _planner fills_ | | | | | | | | | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] `vitest.config.ts` + `playwright.config.ts` — test runner config
- [ ] `tests/setup.ts` — MSW server, shared fixtures
- [ ] `pnpm add -D vitest @vitest/coverage-v8 playwright @playwright/test msw` — if not present

*Planner: expand with per-requirement stub files.*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| _planner fills (e.g. Stripe Customer Portal redirect, real Vercel deploy URL live)_ | | | |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < TBDs
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
